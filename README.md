Communicate PC with MCU via Serial In real Time


A simple program made for debugging.
Reads from Serial with constant COM and Baudrate , values from MCU.
With a press of a hotkey Button 'q' stops printing and you should input your desired Frequency.

If you type any character by mistake it will only get the digits.
Because of my MCU sends uknown characters there is a protected line that gets only alphanumericals.
